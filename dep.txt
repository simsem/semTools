List of reverse dependencies that are checked by CRAN when updating semTools
Last updated: 12 February 2025

Reverse depends
===============

RSAtools: auxiliary()


Reverse imports
===============

conmet: reliability()
https://github.com/leander-ds/conmet
  - emailed 13 Feb 2025 about updating to compRelSEM() and AVE()
  - he noted that Shiny apps imbed old package upon compilation,
    so dependency is not as "strong" (removing reliability() will not break it)

FCO: mardiaSkew(), mardiaKurtosis()

kfa: findRMSEAsamplesizenested()

MBESS: ci.reliability()
  - uses auxiliary()

pwr2ppl: mvrnonnorm()
https://github.com/chrisaberson/pwr2ppl

semdrw:
  - Shiny app, so it shouldn't break when semTools changes

silp: compRelSEM()
https://github.com/TomBJJJ/silp
